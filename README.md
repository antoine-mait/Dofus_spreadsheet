# Dofus Auction House Scraper price Scripts

This project consists of a set of Python scripts designed to automate various tasks related to the Dofus game, including fetching data from the Dofus API, taking screenshots of in-game prices, and transferring data to Google Sheets.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, you will need the following:

- Python 3.10 (or compatible version)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` for a complete list)
- Create an `.env` file with those information : 
```
SCOPES=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"] # or any other scope

SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID="YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"

MAIN_IMG_FOLDER=C:\\path\\to\\your\\HDV_IMG\\ # Feel free to change the directory as you please

folder_dir_tmp =C:\\path\\to\\your\\tmp\images\\tmp_screenshot\\

DOFUS_API="https://api.dofusdu.de"
```
- Google Sheets API credentials for accessing your Google Sheets

## Overview of Scripts

### 1. API_TO_TXT
- Fetches data from the Dofus API and saves it to a text file.
- Retrieves item information and crafting recipes from the API.
- Downloads game item images.
- Designed for learning purposes with the API, not for Google Sheets integration.

### 2. HDV_SCREENSHOT_Bot
- Takes screenshots of in-game prices from the HDV interface.
- Utilizes Tesseract OCR for text recognition to capture price data.
- Selects all item types, takes screenshots, scrolls down, and moves to the next auction house.

### 3. DATA_TO_GSHEET
- Transfers data from the Dofus API to Google Sheets.
- Contains functions to update game prices and import data from text files.
- Some item names may need correction due to their length in the auction house or because of misinterpretation during text recognition.
  - Create a `correction.py` file in the tmp folder 
   ```
   correction_dict = {
                        "Bouiglours": "Boulglours",
                        "Clef de la Chambre de Tal K: â€¦": "Clef de la Chambre de Tal Kasha",
                        # Add other common errors here
                     }
  ```

### 4. Main Controller Script
- Serves as the main entry point for the project.
- Allows users to choose tasks based on input.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the scripts).
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the main script:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. **Follow the on-screen prompts to select the desired operation:**

- 1: API TO TEXT file & IMAGE DOWNLOAD
- 2: UPDATE GAME PRICE
- 3: DOFUS API TO GSHEET
- 4: GAME PRICE TO GSHEET

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions set up in your Google Sheets API for the `DATA_TO_GSHEET` script to function correctly.
- The `HDV_SCREENSHOT_Bot` may require proper configuration for screen resolution and image capture settings.
